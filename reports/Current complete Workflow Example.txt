The Problem

50.000.000/year
startups are launching.
VCs are drowning with 137k
startups arising every day.

2h/day is spent on
gathering information.

Missed opportunities
multiply into costs.
Data is scattered across various
applications and channels.
Every overlooked signal is a
deal lost and ROI.

They’re lost in noise by the time VCs spot trends.
